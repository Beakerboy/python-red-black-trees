# Python red-black trees

[![Python application](https://github.com/emilydolson/python-red-black-trees/actions/workflows/python-app.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/emilydolson/python-red-black-trees/actions/workflows/python-app.yml) [![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/emilydolson/python-red-black-trees/branch/main/graph/badge.svg?token=0LAOX0AEZY)](https://codecov.io/gh/emilydolson/python-red-black-trees)

A Python implementation of red-black trees. This code was originally copied from [programiz.com](https://www.programiz.com/dsa/red-black-tree), but I have made a few tweaks to improve the user interface. I have also fixed a hard-to-catch but serious bug in the original implementation (which has since been propogated to a number of tutorials on the internet), and added a rigorous testing suite to ensure there are no further bugs.

## What is this for?

I made this repo so that students in my algorithms class can try out red-black trees without needing to use C++. Feel free to use it for similar educational purposes! For more practical use-cases, you're probably better off useing the [SortedContainers](http://www.grantjenks.com/docs/sortedcontainers/) library.
